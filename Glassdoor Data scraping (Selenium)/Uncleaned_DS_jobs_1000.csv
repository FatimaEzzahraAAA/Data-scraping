You will solve problems and answer questions – using data – for other departments to help us reduce costs, reduce errors, and be a better organization for our 17 million members.

What You’ll Do

Will understand how the specific task fits into the bigger picture and suggest how to best accomplish within the project framework.

Will self-manage tasks and projects and complete them on time and under general supervision.

Every day, you will help solve business problems presented to us by stakeholders using data. You will get a scenario or problem, such as, “We need to reduce cycle times,” and then pull, analyze, and interpret data relevant to that scenario. You will pull data from SQL databases. You will analyze and interpret data using Python, R, or other tools. You will determine patterns or trends and their statistical significance to the problem. To visualize the data, you will use Tableau.

Once you have done your analysis, paired with a data engineer, you will present your findings to the stakeholder and confirm, refute or simply acknowledge a hypothesis. Your work may be implemented or may develop into something else.

This role is remote, but you must be able to report to the Costa Mesa, California, office for regular collaboration days.

What You’ll Need

To thrive in this role, you must have a solid foundation of statistics and data analysis. You must be able to describe a project where you pulled data, analyzed it, identified trends or patterns, determined significance, and delivered insights or recommendations to the business. What was your approach? What tools did you use and why? Did you get to the root cause of the issue? Did you confirm or refute a hypothesis? You must be able to speak to your involvement and decisions at each stage.

For pulling data, we use SQL so you must be proficient with this tool. To curate and analyze data, we use a variety of languages and programs: Python, R, and even Excel. You can choose whatever tool helps you best, but you must be proficient in either Python or R.

Excellent communication skills and an attitude of flexibility are a must. Very often, we get into the data and some aspect takes longer than we thought, or we have to pivot and change how we approach a problem. A dashboard works better than a model, perhaps. Then you have to explain to the stakeholder or the team why you made that change or why the deliverable is taking longer than expected. It’s all about being creative in your approach and communicating that frequently and clearly to people who may be less tech or data-savvy than you.

UNKNOWN ,ML Engineer,-1,"About the Company
Companies want to train their own large models on their own data. The current industry standard is to train on a random sample of your data, which is inefficient at best and actively harmful to model quality at worst. There is compelling research showing that smarter data selection can train better models faster—we know because we did much of this research. Given the high costs of training, this presents a huge market opportunity. We founded DatologyAI to translate this research into tools that enable enterprise customers to identify the right data on which to train, resulting in better models for cheaper.
Our team has pioneered deep learning data research, built startups, and created tools for enterprise ML.
We have raised over $11.5M from top-tier investors, including Amplify Partners, Radical Ventures, Conviction Capital, Jeff Dean, Yann LeCun, Geoff Hinton, Adam D’Angelo to help make our vision a reality.
This role is based in Redwood City, CA. We are in person 5 days per week and offer relocation assistance to new employees.

Milu Health Logo,Data Scientist,-1,"WE MAKE HEALTHCARE AFFORDABLE FOR AMERICANS
Today, 112 million Americans have trouble paying for healthcare. Nearly 1 in 4 Americans have medical debt. Healthcare costs are skyrocketing, and patients are facing more of that financial burden. We started Milu Health to tackle this problem.


WHO WE ARE
Milu Health is an early stage startup focused on making healthcare affordable for Americans.

Using healthcare pricing data - a 500TB healthcare cost dataset that payers recently have had to release publicly for the first time ever - combined with other healthcare quality and claims data, we think we can change how employers and employees pay for healthcare and ultimately make high-quality medical care more affordable for patients.

Our tools comprise an operating system to reduce a patient's personal healthcare spend - from helping patients identify which high-quality and high-value doctors to go to for a procedure, to informing them about the most affordable prescription options for their medicines, to making sure their medical bills are correct. Through our entire stack, we engage patients through our consumer-facing products and cash-back incentives that can cover their out-of-pocket spend.

We're looking for the best people in the world to dig and build something great with us. It's not going to be easy. There's going to be twists and turns, successes and failures, and tons of learning. But we're in this for the long haul and believe we can fundamentally change a broken system.",4.0,Remote,4.0,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
